# Advanced Examples
The code examples in this repository are arranged into modular functions and classes and include
only minimal inline comments to preserve readability for large examples. They are intended to
demonstrate real-world usage patterns rather than serve as step-by-step tutorials.

Prerequisite: Please read simple_block_capture.py and advanced_block_capture.py first. Those two
files are heavily commented and walk through the PicoScope commands, configuration options, and
typical workflows used across the examples. They provide essential context â€” without them you may
miss important details about device initialization, data capture modes, error handling,
and best-practice settings.
